# Defining a dictionary in Python is straightforward. A dictionary is created using curly braces {} and consists of key-value pairs.
# Each key is unique and maps to a value
# A dictionary is a versatile and powerful data structure in Python.
# It allows you to store, access, and manipulate data efficiently using key-value pairs.
# By understanding how to define and work with dictionaries, you can handle various data management tasks effectively.



'''Creating a new list from an existing one can be done using list comprehensions,
the copy() method, slicing, the list() constructor, the map() function, and the filter() function.
Each method offers different advantages depending on your needs.'''


# A Python dictionary is a built-in data type that allows you to store key-value pairs.
# It's highly versatile and useful for storing and accessing data efficiently.

# Here are some key features and examples:

# Key Features
# Key-Value Pairs: Dictionaries store data in key-value pairs, where each key is unique, and it maps to a value.
#
# Mutable: You can change the contents of a dictionary after it is created.
#
# Unordered: Unlike lists or tuples, dictionaries do not maintain any order for the elements.
#
# Keys: Keys must be immutable types (e.g., strings, numbers, tuples) and should be unique within a dictionary.
#
# Values: Values can be of any type and can be duplicated.

# A Python dictionary is a versatile data structure that allows you to store and manage data using key-value pairs.
#
# It's particularly useful for tasks where you need to quickly retrieve values based on unique keys.

# n Python dictionaries, the get() method is a useful way to retrieve the value associated with a given key.
# One of its key advantages is that it allows you to specify a default value to return if the key does not exist in the dictionary.
# This helps avoid raising a KeyError, which would occur if you tried to access a non-existent key using the standard square bracket notation.
# method is a safe and convenient way to access values in a dictionary.
# It allows you to provide a default value for non-existent keys, preventing errors and making your code more robust.
