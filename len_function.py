# len function and how it works
# output of 6 because it counted the number of elements in rating
# letters and strings all have to go in quotation because they are not going to be recongized as any intetity
# thats how that apart of the syntax works

rating = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 }
size = len(rating)
